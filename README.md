  JSorter sorts out files into folders based on the extensions of the files

Install
=========
1. Requires jre1.8 or later versions of java.
2. `ant jar`
3. java -jar jsorter.jar


Use
========
  1. choose file button -> selects the directory to be sorted
  2. sort button -> after the directory has been chosen, sort initiates the sorting
  3. add button -> say there's an extension that is undefined in JSorter then you can specify that extension
  4. undo button -> undoes everything done by JSorter assuming the .jsorthistory file is still within the directory

Coming soon
============
1. Full functionality of the two check boxes. 
2. Recursive sort
